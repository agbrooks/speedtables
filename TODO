There's a performance hit either way, whether we sort after tagging
lines for deletion, or explicitly mark lines as being tagged for
deletion. The solution is to use the same cycle model as the garbage
collector, either using an explicit cycle tracked in the ctable
structure or a hash to avoid collisions.
