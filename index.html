        <h3>Why Speedtables/CTables?</h3>
<p>
Tcl is not well-known for its ability to represent complex data structures.
Yes, it has lists and associative arrays and, in Tcl 8.5, dicts.  Yes,
object systems such as Incr Tcl provide a way to create somewhat complex
data structures and yes, the BLT toolkit, among probably others, has created
certain more efficient ways to represent data (a vector type, for instance)
than available by default and, yes, you can play games with "upvar" and
namespaces to create relatively complex structures.
</p>
<p>
However, there are three typical problems with rolling your own complex
data structures using lists, arrays, and upvar, or Itcl or Otcl, etc:
</p>
<p>
One is that they are memory-inefficient.  Tcl objects use substantially
more memory than native C.  For example, an integer stored as a Tcl
object has the integer and all the overhead of a Tcl object, 24 bytes
minimum and often way more.  When constructing stuff into lists, there is
an overhead to making those lists, and the list structures themselves
consume memory, sometimes a surprising amount since Tcl tries to avoid
allocating memory on the fly by often allocating more than you need, and
sometimes much more than you need.  (It is not uncommon to see ten or
twenty times the space consumed by the data itself used up by the
Tcl objects, lists, array, etc, used to hold them.  Even on a modern
machine, using 20 gigabytes of memory to store a gigabyte of data is
at a minimum kind of gross and at worst makes the solution unusable.)
(Tcl arrays also store the field name along with each value, which is
inherently necessary given their design but is yet another example of the 
inefficiency of this approach.)
</p>
<p>
The second problem with rolling your own complex structures is that they
are computationally inefficient.  Constructing complicated structures out 
of lists, arrays, etc, traversing and updating them is realtively CPU 
time-consuming.
</p>
<p>
Finally, such approaches are often clumsy and obtuse.  A combination of 
upvar and namespaces and lists and arrays to represent a complex structure,
for example, creates a relatively opaque way of expressing and manipulating 
that structure, making the code twisted, hard to follow, hard to teach, hard
to modify, and hard to hand off.
</p>
<p>
CTables reads a structure definition and emits C code to define that structure.
We generate a full-fledged C extension that manages rows as native C structs,
and emit subroutines for manipulating those rows in an efficient
manner.  Memory efficiency is high because we have very little per-row
overhead (only a hashtable entry beyond the size of the struct itself).  
Computational efficiency is high because we are reasonably clever about 
storing and fetching those values, particularly when populating from 
PostgreSQL database query results, reading them from a Tcl channel containing 
tab-separated data, writing them tab-separated, locating them, updating
them, counting them, as well as importing and exporting by other means.
</p>
<p>
We also maintain a "null value" bit per field and provide ways to distinguish
between null values and non-null values, similar to SQL databases, and 
providing a ready bridge between those database and our tables.
